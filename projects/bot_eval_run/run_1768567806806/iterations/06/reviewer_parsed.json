      "actualBehavior": "The test fails because the `TaskStore` does not appear to be correctly persisted or updated when performing add, list, done, and remove operations. The store may not be properly reading from or writing to the specified JSON file.",
      "diagnosticHints": [
        "Ensure that the TaskStore class is correctly handling file I/O operations (read/write).",
        "Verify that the `add`, `list`, `done`, and `remove` methods are working as expected with respect to state changes and persisting data to/from the JSON file.",

      "testName": "CLI: end-to-end flow",
      "expectedBehavior": "The CLI should function correctly for adding, listing, marking a task as done, and removing tasks.",
      "actualBehavior": "Some tests fail due to incorrect usage of the CLI options or unexpected behavior with `TaskStore` when performing add, list, done, and remove operations. For example, missing title in an add command, non-existent ID in a done/removed command, etc.",
      "diagnosticHints": [
        "Check if all required arguments are being passed correctly by the CLI based on user input.",
        "Verify that `TaskStore` methods are handling IDs, titles, and status changes as expected.",
        "Ensure proper error messages are thrown for invalid inputs or missing arguments.",

      "additionalInstructions": [
        "Review the implementation of `TaskStore` methods that interact with CLI input and output.",

    "The current implementation does not handle file I/O for the JSON tasks storage correctly, which could lead to data loss or corruption when performing CRUD operations.",
    "There are inconsistencies in how the CLI is handling user inputs and validating arguments, leading to test failures."
