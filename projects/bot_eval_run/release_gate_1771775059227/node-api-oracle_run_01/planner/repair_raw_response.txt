  "plan": "We are creating a Node.js project with the following structure: We are given the output format. We must return a JSON object with:\n   - mode: \"full\"\n   - files: an array of objects with \"path\" and \"content\"\n   - notes: optional\n\nSteps:\n1. Create a `package.json` with minimal dependencies and set \"type\":\"commonjs\".\n2. Create a `src/server.js` that exports a function `createServer` which returns a server that handles the endpoints.\n3. Create an `openapi.json` file that defines the OpenAPI 3.x specification for the TODO endpoints.\n4. Create a `README.md` with a brief description."
