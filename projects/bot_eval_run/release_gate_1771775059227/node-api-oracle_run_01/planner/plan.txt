We are creating a Node.js project with the following structure: We are given the output format. We must return a JSON object with:
   - mode: "full"
   - files: an array of objects with "path" and "content"
   - notes: optional

Steps:
1. Create a `package.json` with minimal dependencies and set "type":"commonjs".
2. Create a `src/server.js` that exports a function `createServer` which returns a server that handles the endpoints.
3. Create an `openapi.json` file that defines the OpenAPI 3.x specification for the TODO endpoints.
4. Create a `README.md` with a brief description.
