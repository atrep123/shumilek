  "plan": "We are creating a Node.js project with the following structure:\nWe are given the output format. We must return a JSON object with:\n- mode: \"full\"\n- files: an array of objects with \"path\" and \"content\"\n- notes: optional\nWe are to create a project that meets the specified requirements and passes the provided Oracle tests.\nSteps:\n1. We'll create a `package.json` with minimal dependencies and set \"type\":\"commonjs\".\n2. We'll create a `src/server.js` that exports a function `createServer` which returns a server that handles the endpoints.\n3. We'll create an `openapi.json` file that defines the OpenAPI 3.x specification for the TODO endpoints.\n4. We'll create a `README.md` with a brief description.\nHowever, note that the project must not use any external npm modules except builtin ones.\nWe are to use `node:crypto` for generating unique IDs.\nThe server must:\n- Use CommonJS (require/module.exports)\n- Persist data to a file (JSON) at the given `dataPath` for every mutation.\nWe are to write the code for `src/server.js` that implements the endpoints.\nLet's break down the `src/server.js`:\n- We'll use the `http` module to create the server.\n- We'll use the `fs` and `path` modules for file operations.\n- We'll use `crypto` for generating IDs.\nSteps in `src/server.js`:\n1. Require necessary modules: `http`, `fs`, `path`, `crypto`, and `url` (for parsing paths) and `util` for promisifying fs calls? But note: we are in CommonJS and the tests are using `node:fs` (which is the built-in). However, the test code uses `fs` without the `node:` prefix. But in our code, we can use the built-in modules without `node:` because they are available at the root.\nHowever, note: the test code uses `node:fs` and `node:path` because they are in the Node.js core and available as `fs` and `path` in the global scope. We can use the same.\n2. We'll create a function `createServer({ dataPath })` that returns an HTTP server.\n3. We'll set up the routes:\n- GET /health\n- GET /openapi.json"
