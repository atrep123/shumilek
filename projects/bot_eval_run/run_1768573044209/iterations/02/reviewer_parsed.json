  "errorMessage": "createServer function is missing handling for PUT method to update a todo item. The current implementation only handles POST requests to create new todos and GET requests to retrieve todos. To fully implement the functionality as required by the OpenAPI spec, you need to add a handler for PATCH requests.",
  "suggestedFix": "Add a handler for the PUT method (PATCH in HTTP) within the `createServer` function to allow updating an existing todo item using its ID."
