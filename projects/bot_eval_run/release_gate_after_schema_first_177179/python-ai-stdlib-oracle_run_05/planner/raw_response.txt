{"plan":"We are creating a project with the following structure:\nREADME.md:\n- A short description of the project, installation, and usage.\nmini_ai/__init__.py:\n- Empty or with __all__ if needed.\nmini_ai/markov.py:\n- Class MarkovChain with the required methods and attributes.\nmini_ai/cli.py:\n- Main function with argparse for command line interface.\nWe must ensure that the code meets the oracle tests.\nLet's break down the implementation:\n1. README.md:\n- Project description, installation, and usage examples.\n2. mini_ai/__init__.py:\n- We can leave it empty or with a simple __all__ if we have multiple modules.\n3. mini_ai/markov.py:\n- We'll implement the MarkovChain class with the required methods.\nSteps for MarkovChain:\n- __init__: store order and initialize transitions (a dictionary) and maybe a counter for counts.\n- train:\n- We need to build the n-gram model from the text.\n- We'll consider the context as the last (order-1) characters (for order n, context length is order).\n- We'll traverse the text and for each position i (from order-1 to len(text)-1), the context is text[i-order+1:i] (if order>1) and the next character is text[i+1] (if we are at the last character, we don't have a next, so we skip? or we can consider the end of string as a special state? But the tests don't require that, so we'll just skip the last character for training? Actually, the test uses \"aba\" and order=1, so we need to handle the end.\nHowever, note: the test `test_train_and_to_dict` uses \"aba\" and order=1. The transitions should be:\ncontext \"a\": next char \"b\" with count 1\ncontext \"b\": next char \"a\" with count 1\nBut note: the text \"aba\" has:\nindex0: 'a' -> context for order1 is '' (if we consider the start) but the test doesn't use start. Actually, the test expects:"}
