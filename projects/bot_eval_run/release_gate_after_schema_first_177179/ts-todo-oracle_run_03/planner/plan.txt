We are to create a TypeScript project that compiles to `dist/` and passes the provided Oracle tests.
We cannot use any external npm packages except Node.js builtins.
We must use `node:crypto` for generating IDs if needed, but note that the tests use `TaskStore` which expects a string path for the data file.
Steps:
1. We'll create the following files:
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `src/store.ts`
- `src/cli.ts`
2. We must not use any external packages (like commander, yargs, etc.). We'll use built-in modules.
3. The `TaskStore` must be defined in `src/store.ts` and export the `TaskStore` class.
4. The `Task` type must have: id (string), title (string), done (boolean), createdAt (string), and optionally doneAt (string).
5. The `TaskStore` constructor takes a `filePath` and uses it to read and write a JSON file.
6. The CLI must be built in `src/cli.ts` and must support the commands: add, list, done, remove, and the `--help` flag.
7. We must use `require` for built-in modules because we cannot use ES modules (commonjs). We'll use `const fs = require('node:fs')` etc.
8. The Oracle tests are provided and must be passed.
Implementation:
Let's break down:
a. `package.json`:
- We'll have a minimal package.json with the necessary fields for TypeScript and the test script.
b. `tsconfig.json`:
- We'll set the compiler options to output CommonJS and target ES2015 (or similar) and set the module to commonjs.
c. `src/store.ts`:
- We'll define the `Task` type and the `TaskStore` class.
d. `src/cli.ts`:
- We'll parse the command line arguments and call the appropriate method on the `TaskStore`.
e. `README.md`:
