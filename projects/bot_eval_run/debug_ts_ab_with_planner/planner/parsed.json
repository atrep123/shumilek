  "plan": "We are to create a TypeScript project that compiles to `dist/` and passes the provided Oracle tests.\nWe cannot use any external npm packages except Node.js builtins.\nWe must use `node:crypto` for generating IDs if needed, but note that the tests use `TaskStore` which expects a string path for the data file.\nSteps:\n1. We'll create the following files:\n- `README.md`\n- `package.json`\n- `tsconfig.json`\n- `src/store.ts`\n- `src/cli.ts`\n2. We must not use any external packages (like commander, yargs, etc.). We'll use built-in modules.\n3. The `TaskStore` must be defined in `src/store.ts` and export the `TaskStore` class.\n4. The `Task` type must have: id (string), title (string), done (boolean), createdAt (string), and optionally doneAt (string).\n5. The `TaskStore` constructor takes a `filePath` and uses it to read and write a JSON file.\n6. The CLI must be built in `src/cli.ts` and must support the commands: add, list, done, remove, and the `--help` flag.\n7. We must use `require` for built-in modules because we cannot use ES modules (commonjs). We'll use `const fs = require('node:fs')` etc.\n8. The Oracle tests are provided and must be passed.\nImplementation:\nLet's break down:\na. `package.json`:\n- We'll have a minimal package.json with the necessary fields for TypeScript and the test script.\nb. `tsconfig.json`:\n- We'll set the compiler options to output CommonJS and target ES2015 (or similar) and set the module to commonjs.\nc. `src/store.ts`:\n- We'll define the `Task` type and the `TaskStore` class.\nd. `src/cli.ts`:\n- We'll parse the command line arguments and call the appropriate method on the `TaskStore`.\ne. `README.md`:"
